# FuzzyNotifs

_Have you ever wanted notifications which happen randomly during the day? Well, this does that._

This is a Python GUI app which lets you created reminders which are activated during the day! You can specify biases to specific todos to activate only or more frequently in the morning/evening/midday.

## Running

Install the Python `camel` and `pyside6` packages.

Currently, there's no deployment/packaging process, you can only start the app by running `main.py`.

## Usage

First, you gotta go the Edit tab and add todos by pressing the + button. You can then change the todos' title, amount per day, and bias.

Then, just go to the View tab and you can see when the todos are scheduled to happen.

A tray icon is created when the app is opened, so you can close the main window and re-open it or quit the app by right-clicking on the tray icon.
